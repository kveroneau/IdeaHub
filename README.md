# IdeaHub
A completely offline, portable, and simplified personal project management suite.

This project will be a bit unique in that I will be recording, and potentially *live streaming* it's entire development.  The idea here is fully showcase the powerful abilities of the wildly underrated *ObjectPascal* language, which currently comes in two major flavours, embarcadero's [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), and [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org/)'s [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).  Although there is now a *Community Edition* of Delphi, my operating system of choice is Linux, and currently my only route to programming in ObjectPascal is through FreePascal/Lazarus.

For those wondering what FreePascal and Lazarus are, and how they relate.  FreePascal is the main language itself, but without the cross-platform GUI stuff.  Think of it like perhaps *TCL* without the *TK*, if that makes any sense.  Lazarus combined with it's cross-platform *Lazarus Component Library* can create fully native applications on any operating system it supports.  This means, that if you mainly develop on Linux, and say make it in Qt5 using it's LCL binding, then want to make a port to Windows and macOS, it will not use the Qt5(*unless you ask it*), it will instead use the native widgets of that operating system, and appear as if the application was programmed natively for it, in which it technically is.  Not only does it support this amazing cross-platform app building with very little friction, it will also generate binaries native to the target operating system, use it's native look-and-feel widgets, and with a very small binary size?  What is there not to love about ObjectPascal?  There is no stupid runtime engine, library, or program required.  If you compile a native ELF on Linux, it will link to any system libraries as any local C program would.  So, as long as you ensure the same deps are on your target Linux system, package managers do all of this these days, your package will just be your binary, any shared files, and depend on actual system libraries, and not some bindings.  Your application functions as though it was compiled with C, but without all the complexities that C brings.

Anyways, my hope with building this public app, and publishing videos of it's creation is to drive more awareness to a programming language that perhaps should get a second look.  If you are still someone who thinks very strongly against ObjectPascal, then I highly recommend the following read:
